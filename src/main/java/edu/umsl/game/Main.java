Project Name: Three Pennies
Project Language: Java
Project Description: A game that allows the user to select a sequence of three coins.
The program then creates its own sequence based on the user's sequence. Coins are
then "flipped" in a sequence until one of the aforementioned sequences are found.
This process is repeated 10 times. Afterwards, either a winner is declared, or a draw
is declared. The user will have the option to flip the coin manually. A module exists
in tandem to the game that will explain the process behind the gameplay loop to
the user.
